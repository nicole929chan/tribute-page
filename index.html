            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, Londan.</li>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> - Study as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.</li>
                <li><strong>1936</strong> - Publish his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".</li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Obtains his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the conception of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing.</li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> - Works part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the british codebreaking organisation.  Soon after the July 1939 meeting near Warsaw at which the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages, Turing and Knox developed a broader solution.</li>
